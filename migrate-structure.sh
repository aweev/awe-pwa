# AWE e.V. Final Project Structure Migration Script
#
# This script refactors the project to a locale-first, group-based routing
# structure for the Next.js App Router.
#
# USAGE:
# 1. Save this file as `migrate-structure.sh` in the root of your project.
# 2. Open your terminal and run: `chmod +x migrate-structure.sh`
# 3. Run the script: `./migrate-structure.sh`
# ==============================================================================

# --- SAFETY FIRST ---
# Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status.
set -e
# Treat unset variables as an error when substituting.
set -u
# The return value of a pipeline is the status of the last command to exit with a non-zero status.
set -o pipefail

### 1. Update Middleware (CRITICAL)

Your middleware logic needs to be updated. Since all pages are now localized,
the configuration is often simpler.

**Replace the content of `middleware.ts` with this:**
```typescript
import createMiddleware from 'next-intl/middleware';

export default createMiddleware({
  // A list of all locales that are supported
  locales: ['en', 'de'],

  // Used when no locale matches
  defaultLocale: 'en',

  // The `localePrefix` option is used to control whether the default
  // locale is included in the URL.
  // 'always' - /en/about
  // 'as-needed' - /about (for default locale)
  localePrefix: 'always'
});

export const config = {
  // Match all pathnames except for assets and API routes
  matcher: ['/((?!api|_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico).*)']
};
